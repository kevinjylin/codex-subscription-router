# Architecture

The independently built desktop uses bundle identifier `app.cdxmux.multi`; its
Computer Use helper uses `com.cdxmux.sky.CUAService`. Neither identifier is used
by the official ChatGPT installation. These identifiers and the `.codex-mux`
state directory remain stable across the product rename so existing macOS
privacy grants, connected accounts, and sticky thread ownership continue to
work.

Codex Subscription Router replaces the copied app's bundled `codex` executable
(`Resources/codex-cli/CodexCLI.app/Contents/MacOS/codex`) with a small Go
multiplexer and keeps the original binary beside it as `codex.real`.

## Request routing

The desktop app opens one JSON-RPC app-server connection to the multiplexer.
The multiplexer starts one real app-server child for every enabled account,
each with its own `CODEX_HOME` and `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME`.

New threads are assigned using a quota-urgency score: weekly percentage
remaining divided by the hours until that account resets. Banked usage resets
add a capped bonus, while short-window usage, existing pinned-thread count, and
stable account order break close results. Reset-credit metadata is fetched in
parallel, cached for five minutes, and treated as neutral when unavailable.
Once a thread ID is known, `state.json` persists its owner. Requests, responses,
approvals, and notifications are rewritten only as needed to preserve one
coherent desktop session.

If the owner is depleted, the multiplexer resumes the rollout on an account
with capacity and updates ownership. Threads do not migrate for ordinary load
balancing.

## Account isolation

The Primary account uses `~/.codex`. Added accounts use
`~/.codex-mux/accounts/<id>/codex-home`. Managed configuration is copied from
the Primary account, excluding credential-store settings. Project trust is
shared as a union: entries the isolated account recorded itself take
precedence over the Primary account's. `AGENTS.md`, `agents/`, `hooks.json`,
and `skills/` are symlinked from the Primary home unless the isolated account
already has its own copy.

With `~/.codex-mux/unified-catalog.enabled` present, a reconciler also mirrors
each account's threads into every other connected account's index as pointer
rows (cloned insert-only, referencing the owner's rollout path), so remote
control from a phone signed into any account can see and resume any pooled
session. A turn still runs on the connected account and shares the owner's
rollout writer lock through the common absolute path, so no turn is billed
twice.
Each isolated account forces file-backed CLI and MCP OAuth credentials.

## Desktop integration

The patcher extracts `app.asar`, verifies exact upstream anchors, inserts the
account UI, and repacks the archive with an updated integrity hash, which it
also restamps into the Electron framework's integrity seal. The app receives a
separate Chromium profile and URL scheme.

Sparkle never starts. `ui/router-updater.cjs` takes its place behind the
desktop's own update manager, so the rail button, Check for Updates, and the
install confirmation reflect `scripts/update.py`: a launch agent that builds
the newest published release into `~/.codex-mux/update/staged`, boots it, and
swaps it in after the app quits.

The copied Computer Use service, Node runtime, and callers are re-signed under
one Apple team. The helper uses a separate bundle identity and socket, avoiding
the official app's privacy grants and app-group container.

## Plugin behavior

Plugin definitions and managed MCP configuration are shared. The Plugins page
adds an account selector and marks Apps, MCP status, and MCP OAuth requests with
the selected account ID. The multiplexer removes that private routing marker
before forwarding the strict RPC request to the chosen child.

## Control API

The renderer talks to a loopback-only HTTP service on port 48123. All private
routes require a random 256-bit token. CORS is limited to the copied app's
`app://-` origin. The service exposes account metadata, aggregated usage and
profile data, thread ownership, login/logout actions, and an authenticated SSE
event stream; it never returns OAuth tokens.
