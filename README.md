# Codex Subscription Router

![Multi-subscription account menu](screenshots/account-menu.png)

Use several ChatGPT subscriptions from one macOS Codex app.

The router builds a locally patched copy of the official ChatGPT app, spreads
new chats across your connected subscriptions, fails a depleted thread over to
one with quota, and keeps every thread pinned to one account so context and
caching survive. The official install is read, never modified.

This is the maintained continuation of the original
[codex-subscription-router](https://github.com/b-nnett/codex-subscription-router),
which is archived.

## What you get

- **Quota-aware routing** — new chats go to the subscription whose weekly
  allowance is most at risk of going unused, with a bounded boost for banked
  resets.
- **Sticky threads with failover** — follow-ups stay on their account; a
  depleted owner hands the thread to one with capacity. Only when the whole
  pool is empty does the app show a limit.
- **Manual account switching** — use the avatar beside the model picker to
  move the current chat with its history or save the account new chats start
  on. The new-chat preference persists across restarts; choose **Automatic**
  on the new-chat screen to restore quota-aware routing.
- **Usage across accounts** — the profile menu shows each subscription's
  5-hour and weekly limits, while banners and alerts describe the whole pool.
- **Native account management** — add subscriptions with device-code sign-in,
  see per-account usage and plan, pick an account for rate-limit resets,
  Apps and MCP connections, and Profile statistics.
- **Remote control per subscription** — pair a phone or another computer to
  any account, not only Primary.
- **Independent app** — its own bundle ID, desktop profile, and signed
  Computer Use helper, so it coexists with the official app and holds its own
  macOS privacy grants.

## How it works

```text
Codex Subscription Router.app
        │  one app-server connection
        ▼
    codex-mux
    ├── Primary        → ~/.codex
    ├── Subscription 2 → ~/.codex-mux/accounts/<id>/codex-home
    └── Subscription 3 → ~/.codex-mux/accounts/<id>/codex-home
             └── thread ID → persistent account owner
```

A small Go multiplexer sits between the desktop and one official Codex
app-server per account. Each account has an isolated Codex home; the
multiplexer records which account owns each thread and routes accordingly.
Details: [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [security model](docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md).

## Requirements

- macOS on Apple silicon, with the official ChatGPT app at `/Applications/ChatGPT.app`
  — supported builds are listed in [COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md)
- Xcode Command Line Tools, Go 1.26+, Node.js 22.12+ with npm
- An Apple Development or Developer ID Application identity, or ad-hoc signing
  (`--allow-adhoc-signing`). Ad-hoc builds support Appshots and Computer Use
  through local caller authentication: the copied native helper verifies the
  installing user, expected executable paths, and valid signatures. Screen
  Recording and Accessibility consent is still required; macOS may require
  granting it again after an ad-hoc rebuild.

The patcher verifies the official version, build, ASAR hash, and every code
anchor before changing anything, and refuses unknown builds rather than
half-patching them.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/braindead-dev/codex-subscription-router/main/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

The installer keeps its checkout in `~/.codex-subscription-router/source`,
reuses existing account state on upgrades, backs up the previous build, and
requires the same signing team across rebuilds so privacy grants stay valid.
Read [`install.sh`](install.sh) first if you prefer.

From a clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/braindead-dev/codex-subscription-router.git
cd codex-subscription-router
npm ci --ignore-scripts
python3 scripts/patch_app.py
open "$HOME/Applications/Codex Subscription Router.app"
```

Useful options:

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `CODEX_MUX_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: … (TEAMID)"` | Pick a certificate explicitly |
| `CODEX_MUX_DISPLAY_NAME="Codex (router)"` | Dock and menu bar name; paths and identifiers are unchanged |
| `CODEX_MUX_SIGNING_IDENTITY="-"` | Force ad-hoc signing, even when a certificate is available |
| `--allow-adhoc-signing` | Allow ad-hoc fallback when no certificate is available |
| `--force` | Rebuild over an existing install (previous copy goes to `~/.codex-mux/backups`) |
| `--allow-signing-team-change` | Deliberately rebuild under a different Apple team |

To rebuild without using an Apple development certificate, quit the router and
its Computer Use helper, then run:

```sh
CODEX_MUX_SIGNING_IDENTITY=- python3 scripts/patch_app.py --force --allow-adhoc-signing --allow-signing-team-change
```

The team-change flag allows replacing a certificate-signed install with an
ad-hoc build.

The build creates `~/Applications/Codex Subscription Router.app`, its Computer
Use helper, and a desktop profile under
`~/Library/Application Support/Codex Subscription Router`. Bundles embed
per-user paths; build them on the machine that runs them.

### macOS permissions

**System Settings → Privacy & Security**: grant **Accessibility** to
*Codex Subscription Router* and **Screen & System Audio Recording** to
*Codex Subscription Router Computer Use* (add it with **+** if the row is
missing). These are separate rows from the official app's.

## Use

**Add a subscription** — profile menu (bottom of the sidebar) → *Add another
subscription* → finish the device-code sign-in in the browser. The menu shows
one row per account with its 5-hour and weekly usage.

**Account actions** — each account row shows its 5-hour and weekly usage.
Select a row to reveal *View account usage*, *Copy email address*, and
*Pair a device…*. Viewing usage opens the sheet on that subscription.
Pairing enables remote control for that
account and shows a short-lived code to enter on the phone or computer
(selecting it copies). OpenAI requires multi-factor authentication on the
account; the row says so if it is missing.

**Usage and resets** — the native usage sheet gets an account picker so a
reset is consumed only for the chosen subscription. Profile statistics can be
viewed pooled or per account; Settings → Plugins can scope Apps and MCP
connections to an account.

**Routing**

| Situation | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| New chat | Uses the saved account preference when available; otherwise assigned by quota at risk, banked resets, short-window pressure |
| Follow-up, steer, rename | Sent to the thread's account |
| Owner depleted | Continued on another account with capacity |
| Every account depleted | One combined limit notice with the next reset |
| Account disabled | Excluded from routing and pooled usage |

The thread's subscription appears in its pinned summary. The composer picker
can move that chat or save the subscription new chats start on. Account
switching is handled by the composer; the profile menu manages subscriptions
and usage.

## Updates

The router updates from this repository's published releases, never from
OpenAI's updater. Turn it on once:

```sh
python3 scripts/update.py enable --app "$HOME/Applications/Codex Subscription Router.app"
```

A launch agent checks every hour. Because releases carry source only, it
builds the release against the newest official build that release supports,
boots the result with `scripts/launch_check.py`, and only then shows the app's
own **Update available** button. Clicking it quits the app, installs, and
relaunches. With **Update automatically** checked in the profile menu, a ready
update installs whenever the app quits. **Check for Updates…** in the app menu
checks now. The updater keeps only the installed and staged release sources,
one staged build, one backup, and the official builds a supported release can
use.
`python3 scripts/update.py status` shows the last result and
`~/.codex-mux/logs/update.log` the details.

To rebuild by hand, quit the router and its Computer Use helper, then run
`python3 scripts/patch_app.py --force`. Account state and credentials live
outside the bundle and are untouched.

## Local data

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.codex` | Primary account (shared with the official app) |
| `~/.codex-mux/accounts/<id>/codex-home` | Isolated secondary accounts |
| `~/.codex-mux/state.json` | Accounts and thread ownership |
| `~/.codex-mux/control-token` | Token for the loopback-only control API |
| `~/.codex-mux/backups` | Previous builds and recovery copies |
| `~/.codex-mux/update` | Updater settings, state, staged build, and release sources |
| `~/Library/Application Support/Codex Subscription Router` | Desktop profile |

The control API binds to `127.0.0.1` only and never returns OAuth tokens.
Managed config (MCP servers, plugins, project trust) is synchronized from the
Primary home to each account home, and `AGENTS.md`, `agents/`, `hooks.json`,
and `skills/` are linked to the Primary copies; credentials are not shared. Account homes are
therefore not a secret boundary for inline MCP secrets.

## Development

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run check          # go test/vet, JS, Python, shell
npm run release:check
```

No runtime third-party dependencies; `@electron/asar` is build-only. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [SMOKE-TEST.md](docs/SMOKE-TEST.md), and
[RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).

## Known limitations

- New official builds usually need reviewed anchor updates.
- Initial merged history is capped at 500 threads per account.
- Pooled "skills explored" can count a skill once per account.
- Builds are tied to one macOS user and signing team; releases are source-only.
