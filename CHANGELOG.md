## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Model-aware routing: a new chat that names an OpenAI model goes to a
  subscription the backend lets run it, and switching an existing chat to a
  model its subscription cannot run is refused with the subscriptions that
  can, instead of the backend's error. Models served through another
  provider are not gated.
- Compatibility with official ChatGPT `26.810.52044` (build `6662`) and
  `26.901.22334` (build `7746`), whose renderer splits data access and UI
  across bundles.
- One-command installer with prerequisite checks, signed rebuilds, recoverable
  upgrades, and automatic launch.
- Reset-aware routing that prioritizes weekly quota at risk of expiring and
  gives a bounded boost to subscriptions with banked usage resets.
- Remote-control pairing per subscription from the profile menu, backed by
  `/v1/accounts/{id}/remote-control` control routes.
- `CODEX_MUX_DISPLAY_NAME` sets the Dock and menu bar name of the copied app
  without changing its paths, identifiers, or desktop profile.
- Optional unified thread catalog (flag `~/.codex-mux/unified-catalog.enabled`,
  default off): every connected subscription's index lists the pool's threads,
  so remote control from a phone signed into any account can see and resume any
  session. Turns still run on, and bill, the connected account only. The
  reconciler clones existing rows insert-only and never modifies another
  account's data. On Codex 0.153 and later, whose thread store keeps a
  per-account history projection, the flag is refused and logged once:
  mirrored threads would be unusable there or corrupt the shared rollout.

### Changed

- Native usage surfaces (limit banner, sidebar alert, reset prompts) reflect
  pooled usage, so a depleted Primary account no longer triggers them while
  another subscription still has weekly capacity.
- The account menu, Usage sheet, and Plugins picker open with the last known
  subscriptions and refresh in place instead of showing a connecting state.
- Turn routing reads recently observed account snapshots, kept current by the
  children's rate-limit notifications, instead of querying every app-server
  before each turn.
- Isolated subscriptions inherit the Primary account's project trust; entries
  they recorded themselves take precedence.

### Fixed

- The launcher now starts the patched app from the user's home directory, so
  config and feature-precedence refreshes do not fail when it was invoked from
  a directory that was later moved or deleted.
- Every subscription can use the installed plugins: isolated homes share the
  Primary home's plugin package cache through a link (the old cache is set
  aside), so a plugin enabled in the shared config no longer sits uninstalled
  on another account.
- Unfinished subscription sign-ins no longer pile up in the account list: an
  added subscription that never completed sign-in is removed after an hour.
- Codex 0.153 resumes a thread only from a rollout inside the account's own
  sessions directory, so moving a chat to another subscription now hard-links
  the rollout there instead of resuming it by its original path. The target
  receives what a native home holds: the chat's index row, every rollout
  file (including revert continuations), and every history projection
  stream, taken from the owner's caught-up copy, and resumes by id. A session
  the target still holds from an earlier move cannot be reused, since its
  stale numbering would corrupt the shared rollout, and the turn fails with
  an explanation until the app restarts.
- Features the desktop enables at runtime, such as the paginated thread
  history migration, reach every subscription instead of the controller only;
  without it other accounts answered `list_turns is not supported yet`.
- Pinned chats reorder again, across subscriptions: the multiplexer keeps
  the one pinned order the sidebar shows, applies each move in the account
  whose copy is listed with an anchor that account knows, the merged listing
  keeps that copy's section even when another subscription holds a fresher
  copy, and a thread read reports that same pin so the desktop lets the drag
  start.
- Ad-hoc signed builds can use the in-app Browser and Computer Use: the
  desktop rejected the unsigned bundled `node_repl` on its native pipes with
  `missing-code-signing-identity`, so every subscription saw zero browsers.
- Isolated subscriptions see the Primary home's `AGENTS.md`, `agents/`,
  `hooks.json`, and `skills/`.
- Thread listings no longer flip a moved thread's owner back to the account
  whose history still contains it, so steers and follow-ups reach the account
  running the turn. Moved threads are listed once, with activity from the
  freshest copy, the generated title from the originating account, and a
  user-assigned name from whichever copy received it.
- Threads created on another subscription in a trusted folder no longer run
  read-only with approvals because that account had not recorded the trust.
- The copied app can no longer start Sparkle through the renderer's update
  gate or the Check for Updates menu item.
- Profile menus dismiss normally on outside clicks and Escape after an
  additional subscription sign-in.
